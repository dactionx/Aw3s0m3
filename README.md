Repo for students build for COVID hackathon. The problem/pain point we are looking to solve: As more learners and educators go online, there is little to no support around how to keep students personal information, private and protected. 

Our Solution: A website that analyzes the information from the online learning sites a student/online learner is using and offers a privacy sensitivity score to help gauge how exposed a learner's information is.
