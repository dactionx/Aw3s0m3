# Aw3s0m3
Repo for students build for COVID hackathon. The problem/pain point we are looking to solve: As more learners and educators go online, there is little to no support around how to keep students personal information safe and protected. Possible Solutions: A technical solution that keeps track of which apps you have signed up for (or your school has signed up for you) and what information has been shared with them.
